# Distance between two points

Modify the file located in the folder `src` named `exercise.py`.
Make sure the program works as described below.

## Problem description

Develop and write a Python program that can measure the distance between two
points on the Cartesian Plane.

**Inputs**

The program must ask the user for the coordinates of the initial point
**(x1, y1)** and the final point **(x2, y2)**.
All four values must be of type **float** and must be entered in the order
mentioned.

**Outputs** 

Show the distance between points as a **float** number.

## Sample execution

Example 1 

```plaintext
x1 = 2
y1 = -4
x2 = 5
y2 = 3
distance = 7.62
```

Example 2 

```plaintext
x1 = 5
y1 = 10
x2 = -3
y2 = -4
distance = 16.12
```

**Note:** Do not worry about this part of the code:
```python
if __name__ == '__main__':`
    main()
```
This allows your program to use functions, which is the best practice to
organize code.
Do not modify that part of the code.

## Submit your work

Once you have finished writing your programs, and testing them with `pytest`,
make sure to upload everything to the GitHub repository, by following the steps
to `Commit and Push` the changes.
